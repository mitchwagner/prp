Miscellaneous notes involving subsampling:

    - Subsampling requires a list of all TFs and RECs in the PPI. Right now
      this is found by taking the union of the TFs and RECs for any pathway.
      This means that if the script is run with a small [pathways] list, it can
      have unintended results. See code.

    - If samplesets are regenerated, PathLinker of course must be re-run on all
      of those sets. However, nothing in the code enforces this for now.
      --forcealg must be used to keep everything in sync, but it is very
      expensive.

    - To run this in parallel:
        - First start one process, let it create all of the sample sets in
          serial (this takes a maybe 30 minutes)
        
        - Then kill that process, and start as many as you want with the
          --batch-run flag (and NOT --force-alg). This will run the PathLinker
          step in parallel, which is the expensive step. Note that if any of
          these processes terminate prematurely, they may leave behind
          temporary files where results should be, which is a problem. These
          temporary files can be found by hand (maybe by attempting to do the
          prec-rec computation), and deleted to recover.

        - Note that once you begin this process, you CANNOT run subsampling
          with --forcealg, or you will regenerate the sample sets and leave the
          results in a confusing state. The way to recover is re-running
          everything.

    - I'm still using my own PR calculation code. I believe the task is
      slightly different here because of all of the merging that goes on.
      Either I should convert this to use the standard PR code, or someone
      should look over mine.
